Run the proto file. This represents the free roam state in the first level of my game. At this
point, all you can do is walk around. By the next due date, there will be random fight
sequences implemented. All the sprites are my original drawings including all background elements,
and the music is royalty free. I was also able to successfully implement a game mask.
The fighting mechanic will be implemented in the next due date for the prototype.I should
also be able to include an inventory screen and the ability to enter a few of the village
houses. I do not know exactly how to procede however as far as progressing the story.
I have no clue how to implement a cut scene or text bubbles for NPC's. A demo of this in class
would be awsome.

Anyways, so far so good,
Joshua Knight
